    I’m Albert, a junior developer based in Trondheim, originally from 
    Barcelona. After more than 10 years working in transport and logistics, 
    I decided to transition into software development driven by a long-standing 
    interest in technology and problem-solving.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    I’ve built several real-world web applications, working across both 
    frontend and backend, with a growing focus on frontend development 
    using React. I enjoy turning ideas into clean, usable interfaces and
    connecting them to reliable APIs.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    My background in logistics and customs has given me strong professional 
    maturity, ownership and attention to detail — qualities I now apply to 
    writing maintainable code and collaborating in technical teams.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    I enjoy building projects from scratch, learning by doing, and 
    continuously improving my skills in modern web development.
