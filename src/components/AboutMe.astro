        My name is Albert, I am 30 years old and I am from Barcelona, Spain but now living in Trondheim, Norway. I started with coding 3 years ago. After 10 years working for the transport sector, I decided to change the direction of my professional carreer. A big step in life that I took with the <strong>inconditional</strong>  support of my <em class="italic">family, friends</em> and with a lot of positive energy.

        I finished my studies as <strong>Multiplatform App Developer.</strong> and I am enrrolled in a course of <strong>Back-end development, at Noroff University.</strong> I love to focus in user experience, in order to offer the best experience possible.
