    I'm Albert, a junior full-stack developer originally from Barcelona and
    currently based in Trondheim. After more than 10 years working in the
    transport and logistics sector, I decided to change careers and pursue my
    long-standing interest in technology and problem-solving.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    I started learning programming through self-study and formal education,
    focusing on building real-world applications and understanding how software
    works end to end — from backend logic and APIs to frontend interfaces and
    deployment.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    My technical background includes experience with Java, Python and web
    development. I’ve built several backend-oriented projects involving APIs,
    authentication, databases, testing and deployment, working with systems
    that resemble real production environments rather than purely academic
    exercises.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Coming from more than a decade in logistics and customs, I bring strong
    professional maturity, ownership and the ability to work under pressure in
    critical, time-sensitive environments. That experience taught me the
    importance of reliability, accuracy and accountability — values that align
    closely with building robust software systems.

    <li>🎓 Back-End Development – Noroff (Norway)</li>
    <li>🎓 Cisco Networking – Cisco (online)</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
    I enjoy building projects from scratch, learning by doing and continuously
    improving my skills. I'm particularly interested in web development, clean
    and maintainable code, and I'm open to expanding into areas such as data
    analysis, which I find increasingly interesting. I’m highly motivated to
    keep learning and adapt to whatever technologies a role may require.
